      "I've always felt that sexuality is a really slippery thing. In this day and age, it tends to get categorized and labeled, and I think labels are for food. Canned food.",
      "Canada has a passive-aggressive culture, with a lot of sarcasm and righteousness. That went with my weird messianic complex. The ego is a fascinating monster. I was taught from a young age that I had to serve, so that turned into me thinking I had to save the planet.",
      "The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.",
      "Wisdom doesn't necessarily come with age. Sometimes age just shows up all by itself.",
      "I always thought that I might retire from any form of sexuality by the age of 40 and just become a dignified older person.",
      "I wish I'd gotten sober at a younger age.",
      "I think when the full horror of being fifty hits you, you should stay home and have a good cry.",
      "I vividly remember being 14. That was the age when I started to get happy: I started being a writer and stopped being a loser.",
      "I always wanted to be a designer. I read books on fashion from the age of 12.",
      "Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen."
